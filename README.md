## Abstract
Facial approximation (FA) provides a promising means of generating the possible facial appearance of a deceased person. It facilitates exploration of the evolutionary forces driving anatomical changes in ancestral humans and can capture public attention. Despite the recent progress made toward improving the performance of FA methods, a limited understanding of detailed quantitative craniofacial relationships between facial bone and soft tissue morphology may hinder their accuracy, and hence subjective experience and artistic interpretation are required. In this study, we explored craniofacial relationships among human populations based upon average facial soft tissue thickness depths (FSTDs) and covariations between hard and soft tissues of the nose and mouth using geometric morphometrics. Furthermore, we proposed a computerized method to assign the learned craniofacial relationships to generate a probable facial appearance of Homo sapiens, reducing human intervention. A smaller resemblance comparison (an average Procrustes distance was 0.0258 and an average Euclidean distance was 1.79?mm) between approximated and actual faces and a greater recognition rate (91.67%) tested by a face pool indicated that average dense FSTDs contributed to raising the accuracy of approximated faces. Results of partial least squares (PLS) analysis showed that nasal and oral hard tissues have an effect on their soft tissues separately. However, relatively weaker RV correlations (<0.4) and greater approximation errors suggested that we need to be cautious about the accuracy of the approximated nose and mouth soft tissue shapes from bony structures. Overall, the proposed method can facilitate investigations of craniofacial relationships and potentially improve the reliability of the approximated faces for use in numerous applications in forensic science, archaeology, and anthropology.
